                            Shot put is a sport that is similar in its entirety to the movement of a clenched hand that suddenly opens violently. When performing it, the athlete bends his body, directing his back towards the direction of the throw, then returns to an upright position, performing a complete rotation around himself, and relaxes in a position of complete readiness to release energy. The weight is an iron ball weighing the same as a hammer, 15.9 kg.

                            The sport is similar to discus throwing in terms of movement, and in it the player also rotates several times around himself, trying to give the hammer as much momentum as possible. The hammer consists of the head, which is a metal ball made of iron or copper and weighs 7.257 kg, the cable, which is a steel wire 1.18 meters long, and finally the handle, which is made of solid metal.
